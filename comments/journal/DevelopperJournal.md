Working on cleaning up the mess of Singletons. 

## 2020/02/14

- Note for the future : the current package organization of JSesh is illogical.   
   For future versions, we could have :
  - a package for the model (mdc and sundries)
  - a "component" package, with all components
  - each component having its own package.
  - functions which communicate with jhotdraw should do so through a neutral interface
  - "heavy" functions, like "advanced searches", should take advantage of

The git archive is a bit of a mess, as I performed changes on an old version.

- remove dead or unused branches (production and development)
- do more granular changes
- save often (possibly in local archives)
- I'm trying to understand what changes I have done in the fork. I seem 
  to have set the scale to 1.0 systematically. I need to investigate it.
  Some renaming was also involved, but with a very wrong timing. Don't 
  rename outside of the master. I think it had something to do with scaling not working properly.
  
  The temporary branch has many (relatively logical) renames :
  - BaseGraphics2DFactory -> Graphics2DFactoryIF as it is indeed an interface. 
  - TopItemSimpleDrawer -> TopItemDrawer

Classes dealt with in our modifications :

### Originaly 
- SelectionExporter : uses ExportData and Graphics2DFactoryIF to
export a selection. 

- TopItemDrawer: used in RTFDrawer, for RTF export

- MdCDrawerTemplate (and subclasses): generic copy class, very similar (if not equals to) 
   TopItemDrawer. Has a slightly better name though.

I'm trying to clean the graphical export system.
Many things (like quadrant sizes) are computed 
in various places, and it hurts. 

Now, I was looking at the classes in RTFSimpleExporter
(which I'm probably going to rename RTFExporter. Simple does not give any information here.)

A class like EMFSimpleDrawer seems to be a good candidate to encapsulate decisions.
However, it's currently linked to RTF, and with good reasons:
when we output the EMF content in the RTF stream, the way
of encoding it will definitly be different if 
it's EMF and if it's, say, WMF.

- we need an "embedded picture" system
- in which we want to extract the non-RTF part for reuse.

After some reading, the current architecture is not
so bad. The names of classes need to be updated
to fit their actual use. Also, the scaling/sizing
system is flawed. We have two things called CadratHeight
which behave differently : an "inner" height, which
is a question of proportion between signs and quadrant height,
and the actual height in the resulting file.

While renaming, I guess I should rename setShadeAfter, which 
is difficult to understand, as, setDrawShadeOnTop() or 
something like that. Not done at the moment.
