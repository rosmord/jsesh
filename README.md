# JSesh sources
Welcome to JSesh sources! 

**JAVA 9+ (actually Java 11) version:**


JSesh is a Java hieroglyphic editor 
developed by Serge Rosmorduc (serge.rosmorduc@qenherkhopeshef.org)

JSesh developpers :
- Serge J.-P. Thomas : most of the fonts
- Serge Rosmorduc : almost all the code, a few glyphs in the fonts
- Wayne Collins (CVS, ant improvement)


Licences for the various libraries used by JSesh can be found in resources/licenses

## Source Content 
Contains the following folders and modules:

### Maven modules for JSesh

#### Libraries
* cupAndlex : a bundle with CUP and LEX. Probably usable for other projects as a maven MOJO.
* cupruntime : the CUP runtime, used by JSesh
* jsesh : the main jsesh library (we will remove the application part from it)
* jseshDoc : the module for JSesh documentation
* jseshGlyphs : the main hieroglyphic font
* jvect : vectorial copy/paste library.
* prepareJSeshRelease: a maven mojo for preparing the release (mostly indexing the fonts)
* utils : utilities to update some data files. nothing of interest.
* jhotdrawfw : the "application framework" part of JHOTDRAW 7.

#### Softwares

* jseshAppli : a module containing
  the JSesh application (using JHotdraw)
* jsesh-installer : everthing related to installing JSesh
* codeDumper : a small software to create a dump of JSesh files, 
  as simple lists of codes.

#### Weird compilation behaviour

I have just lost a few hours because JSesh wasn't compiling correctly anymore. It seems that the problem was
due to some IDE project files with a wrong path (in particular, with a wrong path regarding to the generated files.

If you have the following behaviour :

- initial compile is ok, and build files from the CUP and JFlex folder ;
- further builds complain that `MDCParse` doesn't exist

it might be worthwhile deleting `.classpath` and `.project` files in your JSesh folder, and trying again.


## Files and Folders not part of the general maven architecture

* README.md : this file
* TODO.md : ok, a TODO file
* comments: various text files I keep about JSesh, 
    and some unused code (unformal tests and 
    proof-of-concept)

## Working with eclipse:

There seems to be a problem with the eclipse plugin for maven regarding generated sources:
the "jsesh" maven module will report missing classes in eclipse.

A quick fix:

* import the JSesh-all project in eclipse (import maven project)
* open the jsesh module, and, on the pom.xml file, select "run as/maven package".
    This will create the missing files
* then, you need to add the corresponding folders to the jsesh eclipse project as "source folders".

    * In the jsesh module, open target/generated sources
	* Then right click on target/generated sources/cup, and select the menu entry "build path/use as source folder".
		do the same for the target/generated sources/lex folder.
		
That's it.

## Working with VSCode

Interaction between VSCode and Maven is not that easy (again, because of generated files). I'm not sure I will spend the time to do it.



## Building distributions

Due to changes in Java distribution and on Windows and Mac OS X as platform 
(with a strong bias against software not distributed through their respective
stores), the previous java-only distribution system has changed.

JSesh will now embed its own version of Java


The files here are used in the last, non-automated phase of building a
JSesh distribution. 

I will probably try to automate everything at some point, this being said.

### Updating data

This is only done if you are in charge of updating the JSesh text base or the JSesh sign base.
That is, you most probably don't need to do it.

To update the JSesh external data, go to the `utils` folder and type :

~~~bash
ant -f copyData.xml
~~~


------------------------------------
### Building a Mac Distribution:

build the whole project: "mvn install".

1. all files are in jsesh-installer/target/mac. cd there.

5. Ensure main.sh is executable in both apps (JSesh.app and SignInfo.app)
~~~
$ find . -name main.sh -exec chmod a+x {} \;
~~~

3. build a jre for JSesh (check if your path is correct before).

~~~
$ cd JSesh.app/Contents
$ MODULES=java.base,java.desktop,java.naming,java.prefs,java.sql
$ jlink -G -c --no-header-files --no-man-pages --add-modules  $MODULES --output jre
~~~
  (we should identify why on earth java.sql is needed. This being said, it's very small,
   so no harm done.)


6. Check if JSesh and SignInfo are functional (they should start if you double click on them).

7. make a package (.pkg) using the application "Packages" by St√©phane Sudre.
    A config file is provided : JSesh-dist.pkgproj.


#### For Java 11 distributions

A branch of JSesh is being developped to use Java 11. What I currently do is :

- get sure the PATH is correct (includes the jdk for java 11, and not a former one);
- get sure JAVA_HOME is correct (it's used by Maven).

Once JSesh is built, I have played with `jdeps` and `jlinks` to create the correct jre.

I go to folder `jsesh-installer/target/mac/JSesh-7.5.0-SNAPSHOT/JSesh.app/Contents/lib`, and
I build a shell script for jdeps:
~~~sh
JARS=bcmail-jdk14-138.jar:....:signInfoAppli-7.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:swing-layout-1.0.3.jar
jdeps --ignore-missing-deps --list-deps -cp $JARS jseshAppli-7.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
~~~
where JARS is made from all jars in the folder. There are some missing dependencies related to mail, but JSesh doesn't use 
mail, so it's not an issue.

It gives me the list of modules needed by JSesh:
~~~
   java.base
   java.datatransfer
   java.desktop
   java.logging
   java.naming
   java.prefs
   java.sql
   java.xml
~~~

I use this list to build and run the following script:
~~~sh
MODULES=java.base,java.datatransfer,java.desktop,java.logging,java.naming,java.prefs,java.sql,java.xml
jlink --no-header-files --no-man-pages --add-modules  $MODULES --output jre
~~~

The resulting jre folder should be placed in Contents. The corresponding JRE is 75M large, which is smaller than the
jre for 1.8 which was included in JSesh previously. This is not yet the master version, as I need to fix bugs.

------------------------------------
### Windows distribution

1. copy the files from target/windows into a Windows machine
2. copy a 32 bit JRE in the JSesh folder on Windows. Ensure it's named "jre".
3. start lauch4J and use the jsesh-bundler.xml file. It should create JSesh.exe in the JSesh folder.
4. same for the file signInfo-bundler.xml
5. run Inno Setup on jsesh-inno.iss. Generate a new ID for the build before building.

- *Note : we will probably use jlink as above to generate the JRE*
- **Important** : check if launch4j wants a JDK or a 64bit executable.

## Starting JSesh a different language for menus...

This should obviously move to a menu. But meanwhile:

JSesh chooses the menu languages depending on your computer setting. Sometimes, you might want a different language than the one used by your computer. For instance, as most of the tutorials, discusssions, etc. are in English, you might want to swich to the English version of JSesh.

To do this, you currently need to start JSesh on the command line, which is a bit technical.

The command would be :

    java -Duser.language=en -jar jseshAppli-7.8.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

(replace "en" by the two-letters code for your language)

## Note about github distribution (for personnal use mainly)

To get the number of downloads for version 7.2.0 :

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rosmord/jsesh/releases/11259307
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove the last number for all releases.
