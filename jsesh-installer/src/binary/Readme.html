		<title>JSesh Hieroglyphic Editor</title>
	</head>
<body>
<p>JSesh is both a hieroglyphic text editor, which follows quite closely the manuel de codage,
and a java library for the manipulation of hieroglyphic texts. It is thus distributed
with its complete sources, and a technical documentation.
</p>

To start JSesh, simply click on jseshAppli.jar (in the libs directory).
</p>

<p>Enjoy ! </p>

<p> JSesh has been mainly programmed by Serge Rosmorduc. 
<p> M. Serge J. Thomas is actively contributing quite a few hieroglyphs to the sign list. Thanks a lot, M. Thomas!
<p>JSesh uses the following libraries :</p>
<ul>
<li> JHotDraw 7, by Werner
			Randelshofer (http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/jhotdraw/index.html),
			which provides a nice, Mac-Friendly, document-oriented system, and is
			usable for lots of projects, even those which don't deal with vector
			graphics.
<li>IText, a very complete pdf library for java (http://www.lowagie.com/iText/) ; distributed under either the LGPL or the Mozilla public license.</li>	
<li>IzPack for its installer :
http://www.izforge.com/izpack/, available under the GPL, but the
distributed software itself can have any license.</li> <li>JLex for
the lexical analyser :
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/ . License : see
directory licenses </li> <li>JCup for the
parser. http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/. License :
see directory licenses</li> 
<li> The quaqua look and feel library for the mac provides a better mac user experience. It's made by
	Werner Randelshofer (http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/) and distributed under the LGPL license.
</li>
<li> The form layout library is available from http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries.html, under the BSD open source license.</li>
<em>The text of all these licenses can be found in the licenses directory of the JSesh installation.</em>

<p>
Everything in JSesh (for versions distributed after the 1st may 2011), except the previously quoted libraries, is
distributed under the CeCILL license (which is compatible with the GNU GPL license).
In practical terms, this means that any project including code from JSesh must be distributed with a license compatible with the GPL.
(Note that this applies to the software, not to the documents produced with it. If you create books or PDF using JSesh, you are free to distribute them the way you want)

<p>According to the CeCILL or GNU License, it's possible to include JSesh code in commercial projects, but they must themselves be distributed along the CeCILL license.
Now, if you need to use JSesh for a commercial closed-source project, contact me. <p>
<p>As a rule, I'm likely to allow its use under less restrictive terms if the project is scientifically important.
