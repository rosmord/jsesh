		<title>JSesh Hieroglyphic Editor</title>
	</head>
<body>
<p>JSesh is both a hieroglyphic text editor, which follows quite closely the manuel de codage,
and a java library for the manipulation of hieroglyphic texts. It is thus distributed
with its complete sources, and a technical documentation.
</p>

To start JSesh, simply click on jseshAppli.jar (in the libs directory).
</p>

<p>Enjoy ! </p>

<p> JSesh has been mainly programmed by Serge Rosmorduc. 
<p> M. Serge J. Thomas is actively contributing quite a few hieroglyphs to the sign list. Thanks a lot, M. Thomas!
<p>JSesh uses the following libraries :</p>
<ul>
<li>IText, a very complete pdf library for java (http://www.lowagie.com/iText/) ; distributed under either the LGPL or the Mozilla public license.</li>	
<li>IzPack for its installer :
http://www.izforge.com/izpack/, available under the GPL, but the
distributed software itself can have any license.</li> <li>JLex for
the lexical analyser :
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/ . License : see
directory licenses </li> <li>JCup for the
parser. http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/. License :
see directory licenses</li> 
<li> The quaqua look and feel library for the mac provides a better mac user experience. It's made by
	Werner Randelshofer (http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/) and distributed under the LGPL license.
</li>
<li> The form layout library is available from http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries.html, under the BSD open source license.</li>
<em>The text of all these licenses can be found in the licenses directory of the JSesh installation.</em>

<p>
Everything in JSesh, except the previously quoted libraries, is
distributed under the LGPL. In practical terms, this means that :
<ul>
      <li>If you include jsesh.jar as a library in one of your
		program, you are free to distribute the said program
		with the license of your choice, open-source or not.
      </li>
      <li>
		On the other hand, if you modify JSesh itself, the
		modifications should be redistributed under the LGPL.
      </li>

</ul>
Note that if you modify JSesh for a non LGPL project, you might still distribute your project
with a "closed" license, as long as the modified part of JSesh <em>is</em> distributed under 
the LGPL.
