-------- TODO in next release
* We now allow to chose which type of data will be exported while cutting and pasting.
  It's thus possible to try to cut and paste PDF, which works on the mac (except that at least some versions
of word don't understand anything about it. The same goes for OpenOffice).

------- TODO later.
* Changed to MDI (Multiple Document Interface)
* Internationalized version. Menus now available in English and in French. Contact me if you want to create a version for your language, it's not difficult.
* Small performance improvement: changed a few Readers/Streams to Buffered
