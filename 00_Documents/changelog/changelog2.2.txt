For users:
* Cut and paste in RTF added ! You can now paste text into word or openoffice !
* After calling "New", the file name is now reset to default file name. I've just lost a looong file because of the previous behaviour :-(
* bug fixes : Jsesh acted in a strange way when working at the end of a document (see in developer section for the gory details).
* better scrolling with the keyboard.

For developpers:
* cleanup of ViewBuilder. The drawingSpecifications are no longer part of the builder object.
* Important bug fix. There was a nasty bug when text was suppressed at the end of a document.
		Technical detail : marks in the text (insert and selection cursors) were updated after some components (like the drawing window)
		were warned of the text change. Thus, Jsesh attempted to draw parts which were no longer there.
* Improved reactivity. Better experience when navigating through the text using the keyboard.
		Tech. detail : we used to change the drawing view and the MDC text window immediatly when the document was changed.
		The result was that the scrolling wasn't smooth when navigating using the keyboard arrows. Now, 
		these changes are made using SwingUtilities.invokeLater(), and the scrolling is much better.
* Objects of class ModelElement no longer extend Observable. Instead a new, simpler Observer pattern is set. See ModelElement for more info.
* Lots of things are left to cleanup.
* change in the "run" target of the build.xml file. JSesh now runs in netbeans.
