New features:
* Improved ligature system. The font designer has now more control on the 
way a ligature will behave.

* Much improved layout for groups with high signs and low broad signs. Those signs
will tend to fill the available space, giving a better result especially in columns.

* bug fix for horizontal grouping (used to destroy complex ligatures).

* Moved the documentation to docbook, to solve the problem of navigation in the documentation,
and to allow the creation of a pdf version thereof.

* Cleaned up the extended signs. Some of them did not have the right code.

* The user can now specify the encoding to use when reading or writing a MdC file.

* Texts from the old Tksesh database are now included in the JSesh distribution, along with a few new ones, 
  among which Israel Stela and the Kamose Stela.
  
* Small improvement when including signs from a font: the same scaling is retained for all signs.

* bug fixed in PDF layout: Cartouches are now aligned correctly in PDF output.
