The JSesh header is a proprietary header for JSesh, which will complement MdC 2007 as soon 
as MdC 2007 exists.

It starts with:

++JSESH_FILE
and ends with +s
The whole header is on ONE line.

The header content is in JSON format (as I don't want to reinvent the wheel).
(BTW, why not considering using JSON as format for the "next" MdC, huh ?)
(because you can't write a DTD ?)

e.g.
++JSESH_FILE {"version" : "2", "encoding" : "utf-8"}+s

fields: 
	jsesh_format : the version of the JSESH format used for saving this file. 
		I do say : any tksesh file (.hie) is version 0, old glyph compatible files are version 1
			the current version is 2. This is a STRING
			
	encoding: well, the char encoding the JSesh file uses.

	page: a description of the page, the unit being 1/72inch.
			e.g. "page" : {"width" : 720, "height" : 720, "dx" : 31, "dy" : 31, "textWidth" : 600, "textHeight" : 600, orientation: "landscape"}
				orientation is either landscape or portrait.
				in landscape mode, the x axis is vertical (bottom to top), and the y axis is left to right.
				in portrait mode, the origin is on the top left of the page, and y is down the page.
				
				dx, dy is the position of the origin on the page.
			If no page is described, jsesh will be in pageless mode.

	orientation: "lines" or "columns"
	direction: "left to right" or "right to left"
	"small signs centered" : true or false

Forthcoming info: 
	output transliteration encoding: one of "mdc" or "unicode"
