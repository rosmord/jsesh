# Simplify view architecture

Currently, we have

- JSeshView uses...
- JSeshViewModel uses...
- JSeshViewComponent uses ...
- JMDCEditor uses ...
- JMDCEditorWorkflow ... 

And some methods placed on the top level call 
methods of JMDCEditorWorkflow.

- JSeshView is a view as mandated by the JHotdraw framework
- JSeshViewModel is an "abstract" representation of this view
- JSeshViewComponent is the collection of graphical components used by JSeshViewModel
- JMDCEditor is the actual hieroglyphic editor component
- JMDCEditorWorkflow is the logic behind this editor.

The difference between the top two layers is small.

Besides, publishing the functionalities through interfaces would be a nice approach to filter away 
irrelevant functionalities.
