# Harmonize the I18n system and use consistent naming

The current naming system for labels and the like for JSesh
is not coherent. In fact, we use multiple systems for historical
reasons (we had our own system, then we used jhotdraw, etc...)

As a result, it's a mess.

We currently have (at least) :

- in jsesh: jsesh.editor.labels
- in jseshLabels: jsesh.resources.labels

In the first one, labels are suffixed with "Name". In the second one, they are suffixed with "text".
