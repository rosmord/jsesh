# JHotdraw

This is a fork from [Werner Randelshofer's version of JHotdraw](https://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/jhotdraw/index.html).

I use JHotdraw as a generic application framework (not as a drawing app), as Werner Randelshofer has written a sound basis for document-oriented softwares.

You can license JHotDraw 7 either using an LGPL license or using a Creative Commons Attribution (by) 2.5 license.

I use the LGPL here.
